I want you to analyze job descriptions and label them with a seniority level: "junior," "medior," "senior," or "not specified." The output should be a single column containing only the seniority label without any explanation or row numbers.

Label based on:

Literal mentions of terms like "junior," "medior," or "senior" in the job description.
Years of experience required: use "junior" for 0-2 years, "medior" for 3-5 years, and "senior" for 6+ years.
If multiple seniorities are mentioned, use the lowest level (e.g., if both "junior" and "senior" are mentioned, output "junior").
If no terms or years of experience are mentioned, label as "not specified."
The input will be provided as a list of job descriptions.
